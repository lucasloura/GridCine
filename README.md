# GridCine

  GridCine is a project developed by me, denis e isac as a college assignment during April-June of 2022. The proposal of the assignment was to make an off-the-shelf software from which the topic could be chosen from some that the teacher suggested (we chose box office), in VB.Net, using knowledge learned simultaneously in disciplines such as software engineering, information systems and human-computer interaction.
  We faced many challenges during development, but we learned a lot of important and interesting things as well, such as the need of writing well defined requirements (be it functional and non-funcitional), the importance of getting a prototype right and actually coding something more serious, something that could be potentially sold.
  There are still many things to improve and fix, of which I plan on coming back soon to do so, but overall we are quite proud of what we achieved and believe that it turned out pretty good.
